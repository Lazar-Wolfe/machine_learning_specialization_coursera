1. In the training set below, what is x<sub>4</sub><sup>(3)</sup>? Please type in the number below (this is an integer such as 123, no decimal points).
30
Correct
Yes! x_4^{(3)} is the 4th feature (4th column in the table) of the 3rd training example (3rd row in the table).

2. Which of the following are potential benefits of vectorization? Please choose the best option.

- [ ]It makes your code run faster
- [ ]It can make your code shorter 
- [ ]It allows your code to run more easily on parallel compute hardware
- [x]All of the above

Correct
Correct! All of these are benefits of vectorization!

3. True/False? To make gradient descent converge about twice as fast, a technique that almost always works is to double the learning rate alphaalpha. 
- [ ]True
- [x]False

Correct
Doubling the learning rate may result in a learning rate that is too large, and cause gradient descent to fail to find the optimal values for the parameters ww and bb.
