1. For linear regression, the model is f<sub>w,b</sub>(x) = wx + b. 
Which of the following are the inputs, or features, that are fed into the model and with which the model is expected to make a prediction?
- [ ] w and b.
- [ ] m
- [x] x
- [ ] (x,y)

Correct
The x, the input features, are fed into the model to generate a prediction f<sub>w,b</sub>(x) 

2. For linear regression, if you find parameters ww and bb so that J(w,b)J(w,b) is very close to zero, what can you conclude?
- [ ] This is never possible -- there must be a bug in the code. 
- [ ] The selected values of the parameters ww and bb cause the algorithm to fit the training set really poorly.
- [x] The selected values of the parameters ww and bb cause the algorithm to fit the training set really well.
Correct
When the cost is small, this means that the model fits the training set well.
