1. In this lecture series, "cost" and "loss" have distinct meanings. Which one applies to a single training example?

- [x] Loss

Correct
In these lectures, loss is calculated on a single training example. It is worth noting that this definition is not universal. Other lecture series may have a different definition.
- [ ] Cost 
- [ ] Both Loss and Cost
- [ ] Neither Loss nor Cost 

2. For the simplified loss function, if the label y^{(i)}=0y 
(i)
 =0, then what does this expression simplify to?


-log(1-f(x^{(i)}))

Correct
When y^{(i)}=0y 
(i)
 =0, the first term reduces to zero.
