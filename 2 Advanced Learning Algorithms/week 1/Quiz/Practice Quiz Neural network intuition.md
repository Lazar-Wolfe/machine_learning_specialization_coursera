## Week 1 Quiz - Neural Network Intuition
1. Which of these are terms used to refer to components of an artificial neural network? 

1 / 1 point

- [x] activation function 

Correct
Yes, an activation is the number calculated by a neuron (and an activation is a vector that is output by a layer that contains multiple neurons).


- [x] layers

Correct
Yes, a layer is a grouping of neurons in a neural network


- [x] neurons

Correct
Yes, a neuron is a part of a neural network


- [ ] axon

2. True/False? Neural networks take inspiration from, but do not very accurately mimic, how neurons in a biological brain learn.

1 / 1 point

- [x] True 


- [ ] False

Correct
Artificial neural networks use a very simplified mathematical model of what a biological neuron does.
